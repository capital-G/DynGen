DESCRIPTION::

See LINK::Classes/DynGen:: for a full introduction.

LINK::Classes/DynGen:: defers the initialization of the EEL2 VM into a non-realtime thread.
This introduces a delay of at least one block size.
If therefore sample accurate sequencing becomes necessary, it is also possible to init the EEL2 VM within the realtime-audio thread, though this can lead to audio-dropouts and is therefore not advised.
See the example below.
